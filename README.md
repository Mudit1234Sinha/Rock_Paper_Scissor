# Rock_Paper_Scissor

Here I have made a Rock_Paper_Scissor game using OpenCV. I have used images of Rock Paper Scissor, which will be randomly

displayed by your Computer on the Background Screen and you will use hands to play with computer.There's also a scoring system

which will tell whether player won or the computer by detecting your hands

Modules I have used are

1) Cv2- OpenCV library

2) CvZone - Here i have imported HAndTracking module for easy detection of your hands using landmark points
